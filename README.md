Hello! I'm Emily, and I’m currently completing my B.S. in Computer Science at SNHU, graduating in December 2025. I discovered a strong interest in data analysis and business intelligence through my coursework, and I’m excited to pursue a career where I can transform data into insights that support better decision-making.</p>
<br>
Welcome to my CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio. This portfolio showcases my enhanced artifacts, reflections, and mastery of the program outcomes, including:

- Software Design and Engineering  
- Algorithms and Data Structures  
- Databases  

It also connects these artifacts to my long-term goals as an aspiring **Data Analyst** and **Business Intelligence Analyst**.

Below are the three main enhanced artifacts aligned with the capstone categories. Each artifact includes a summary, the associated outcome, and links to code and reflections.

### 1. Software Design & Engineering – Course Planner (CS-300)

- **Artifact:** Refactored Course Planner application  
- **Original Course:** CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms  
- **Summary:**  
  The original single-file Course Planner was redesigned into a modular, multi-layered application with separate classes for the model (`Course`), data access (`CourseRepository`), service logic (`CourseService`), and user interface (`MenuUI`). This refactor improves readability, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Outcome Focus:** Software design, modular architecture, and clean separation of concerns.

<p align="center">Hello! I'm Emily, and I’m currently completing my B.S. in Computer Science at SNHU, graduating in December 2025. I discovered a strong interest in data analysis and business intelligence through my coursework, and I’m excited to pursue a career where I can transform data into insights that support better decision-making.</p>

Welcome to my CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio. This portfolio showcases my enhanced artifacts, reflections, and mastery of the program outcomes, including:

- Software Design and Engineering
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Databases

It also connects these artifacts to my long-term goals as an aspiring **Data Analyst** or **Business Intelligence Analyst**.

Throughout my academic journey in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have grown significantly both technically and professionally. When I began the program, I expected to pursue software engineering or full-stack development. However, as I progressed, especially after excelling in Applied Statistics I and II, I discovered my strengths and passions lie in data-focused roles. I deeply enjoy analyzing information, uncovering insights, and helping others make informed decisions. This led me to pursue a long-term career goal of becoming a **Data Analyst** or **Business Intelligence Analyst**, roles that blend analytical reasoning with organizational impact.  
  
The capstone enhancements showcased in this ePortfolio demonstrate my mastery of the five Computer Science Program Outcomes and reflect the culmination of everything I have learned throughout my degree. Revisiting previous coursework, redesigning artifacts, and applying feedback allowed me to grow into a more intentional and capable computing professional.  
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="images/outcome1.png"></div>

I strengthened my collaboration and communication skills throughout the program and during the capstone. In **Milestone One**, I performed a detailed code review that required analyzing another developer’s work, identifying improvement opportunities, and articulating recommendations clearly. This experience reflects the ability to contribute to team-based problem-solving and support organizational goals, which is central to Outcome 1.  
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="images/outcome2.png"></div>

Professional communication was demonstrated through written enhancement narratives, UML diagrams, and my recorded screencast review. Explaining software architecture decisions, algorithmic trade-offs, and database integration strategies reinforced my ability to communicate technical information to both technical and non-technical audiences. This ePortfolio is also intentionally structured to demonstrate clarity, organization, and professionalism.  
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="images/outcome3.png"></div>

I demonstrated my understanding of algorithmic design and evaluation by enhancing my **CS-300 Data Structures Comparison** artifact. This included expanding the pseudocode, analyzing runtime performance, and comparing the trade-offs among vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. This aligns with Outcome 3 by showcasing my ability to design and assess computing solutions using appropriate algorithmic techniques.  
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="images/outcome4.png"></div>

A major artifact in this ePortfolio is the redesigned **Course Planner** application. I transformed it from a single-file program into a modular, multi-layered, object-oriented application. Later, I expanded it further by integrating a relational **MySQL database** using MySQL Connector/C++ and secure parameterized SQL queries. These enhancements demonstrate my ability to use modern tools, frameworks, and development techniques, fully addressing Outcome 4.  
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="images/outcome5.png"></div>

I demonstrated secure coding practices by adding input validation, strengthening exception handling, and documenting best practices for secure credential storage. Although the capstone environment uses hard-coded credentials for demonstration, I clearly note that production systems require environment variables or secure credential stores. This satisfies Outcome 5 by showing an understanding of potential vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them.  
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="images/final-reflection.png"></div>

Across all milestones, I earned **100%**, reflecting mastery of both the technical and professional expectations of the CS program. The process of refining previous coursework, enhancing it with modern practices, and preparing it for public presentation helped me develop a professional identity grounded in clarity, intentionality, and analytical rigor.  

This ePortfolio synthesizes my growth in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. It also reflects my readiness to enter the workforce as a data-driven professional capable of supporting business intelligence, analytics, and organizational decision-making. Completing the capstone has solidified my confidence and prepared me to move forward into a fulfilling career in **Data Analysis** or **Business Intelligence**.

As part of the CS-499 capstone, I conducted a comprehensive code review of my selected artifacts, evaluating software design decisions, algorithmic efficiency, and database integration strategies. This review informed the enhancements implemented throughout the capstone.

Below are the three main enhanced artifacts aligned with the capstone categories. Each artifact includes a summary, the associated outcome, and links to code and reflections.  
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="images/artifact1.png"></div>

- **Artifact:** Refactored Course Planner application  
- **Original Course:** CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms  
- **Summary:** The original single-file Course Planner was redesigned into a modular, multi-layered application with separate classes for the model (`Course`), data access (`CourseRepository`), service logic (`CourseService`), and user interface (`MenuUI`). This refactor improves readability, maintainability, and scalability.  
- **Outcome Focus:** Software design, modular architecture, and clean separation of concerns.

 <br>
<div align="center"><img src="images/artifact2.png"></div>

- **Artifact:** Data structures performance comparison (vector, hash table, binary search tree)
- **Original Course:** CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms
- **Summary:** This artifact analyzes how different data structures perform for loading, searching, and traversing course data. The enhancement work includes fleshed-out pseudocode, runtime measurements, and reflection on when each data structure is most appropriate.
- **Outcome Focus:** Algorithmic thinking, time complexity, and choosing appropriate data structures.

 <br>
<div align="center"><img src="images/artifact3.png"></div>

- **Artifact:** Course Planner with MySQL database support (CS-300 enhanced in CS-499)  
- **Original Course:** CS-300: Data Structures & Algorithms  
- **Summary:** For Milestone Four, the Course Planner was extended to load and save course data using a MySQL relational database. A `courses` table stores `course_id`, `title`, and `prereqs`. The application uses MySQL Connector/C++ with parameterized SQL queries, and the user may choose to load data either from a CSV file or directly from the database.  
- **Outcome Focus:** Databases, relational schema design, secure parameterized queries, and data access integration.

This section explains how each artifact supports the Computer Science program outcomes.

- **Software Design & Engineering:** Demonstrated through modular design, layered architecture, and clean interfaces in the Course Planner refactor.  
- **Algorithms & Data Structures:** Demonstrated by comparing and analyzing multiple data structures for course storage and retrieval, with attention to runtime performance and trade-offs.  
- **Databases:** Demonstrated via integration of MySQL with parameterized queries, schema design for the `courses` table, and dynamic loading/saving of course data.

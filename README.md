<p align="center">Hello! I'm Emily, and I’m currently completing my B.S. in Computer Science at SNHU, graduating in December 2025. I discovered a strong interest in data analysis and business intelligence through my coursework, and I’m excited to pursue a career where I can transform data into insights that support better decision-making.</p>

<img src="images/linebreak.png">

Welcome to my CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio. This portfolio showcases my enhanced artifacts, reflections, and mastery of the program outcomes, including:

- Software Design and Engineering
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Databases

It also connects these artifacts to my long-term goals as an aspiring **Data Analyst** and **Business Intelligence Analyst**.

<p align="center"><img src="images/artifacts-header.png"></p>

Below are the three main enhanced artifacts aligned with the capstone categories. Each artifact includes a summary, the associated outcome, and links to code and reflections.

<p align="center"><img src="images/artifact1.png"></p>

**Artifact:** Refactored Course Planner application
**Original Course:** CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms
**Summary:** The original single-file Course Planner was redesigned into a modular, multi-layered application with separate classes for the model (`Course`), data access (`CourseRepository`), service logic (`CourseService`), and user interface (`MenuUI`). This refactor improves readability, maintainability, and scalability.
**Outcome Focus:** Software design, modular architecture, and clean separation of concerns.

<ul>
   <li><b>Artifact:</b> Data structures performance comparison (vector, hash table, binary search tree)</li>
   <li><b>Original Course:</b> CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms</li>  
   <li><b>Summary:</b> This artifact analyzes how different data structures perform for loading, searching, and traversing course data. The enhancement work includes fleshed-out pseudocode, runtime measurements, and reflection on when each data structure is most appropriate.</li>
   <li><b>Outcome Focus:</b> Algorithmic thinking, time complexity, and choosing appropriate data structures.</li>

   <li><b>Artifact:</b> Course Planner with MySQL database support (CS-300 enhanced in CS-499)</li> 
   <li><b>Original Course:</b> CS-300: Data Structures & Algorithms</li>
   <li><b>Summary:</b> For Milestone Four, the Course Planner was extended to load and save course data using a MySQL relational database. A <code>courses</code> table stores <code>course_id</code>, <code>title</code>, and <code>prereqs</code>. The application uses MySQL Connector/C++ with parameterized SQL queries, and the user may choose to load data either from a CSV file or directly from the database.</li>
   <li><b>Outcome Focus:</b> Databases, relational schema design, secure parameterized queries, and data access integration.</li>

This section explains how each artifact supports the CS program outcomes:<br>
<br>
<ul>
   <li><b>Software Design & Engineering:</b> Demonstrated through modular design, layered architecture, and clean interfaces in the Course Planner refactor.</li>
   <li><b>Algorithms & Data Structures:</b> Demonstrated by comparing and analyzing multiple data structures for course storage and retrieval, with attention to runtime performance and trade-offs.</li>
   <li><b>Databases:</b> Demonstrated via integration of MySQL with parameterized queries, schema design for the <code>courses</code> table, and dynamic loading/saving of course data.</li>
</ul>

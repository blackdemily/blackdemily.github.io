Welcome to my CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio. This portfolio showcases my enhanced artifacts, reflections, and mastery of the program outcomes, including:

- Software Design and Engineering  
- Algorithms and Data Structures  
- Databases  

It also connects these artifacts to my long-term goals as an aspiring **Data Analyst** and **Business Intelligence Analyst**.

Below are the three main enhanced artifacts aligned with the capstone categories. Each artifact includes a summary, the associated outcome, and links to code and reflections.

### 1. Software Design & Engineering – Course Planner (CS-300)

- **Artifact:** Refactored Course Planner application  
- **Original Course:** CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms  
- **Summary:**  
  The original single-file Course Planner was redesigned into a modular, multi-layered application with separate classes for the model (`Course`), data access (`CourseRepository`), service logic (`CourseService`), and user interface (`MenuUI`). This refactor improves readability, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Outcome Focus:** Software design, modular architecture, and clean separation of concerns.

### 2. Algorithms & Data Structures – Data Structures Comparison (CS-300 Project Two)
- **Artifact:** Data structures performance comparison (vector, hash table, binary search tree)  
- **Original Course:** CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms  
- **Summary:**  
  This artifact analyzes how different data structures perform for loading, searching, and traversing course data. The enhancement work includes fleshed-out pseudocode, runtime measurements, and reflection on when each data structure is most appropriate.
- **Outcome Focus:** Algorithmic thinking, time complexity, and choosing appropriate data structures.

### 3. Databases – Course Planner with MySQL Integration
- **Artifact:** Course Planner with MySQL database support (CS-300 enhanced in CS-499)  
- **Original Course:** CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms  
- **Summary:**  
  For Milestone Four, the Course Planner was extended to load and save course data using a MySQL relational database. A `courses` table stores `course_id`, `title`, and `prereqs`. The application uses MySQL Connector/C++ with parameterized SQL queries, and the user may choose to load data either from a CSV file or directly from the database.
- **Outcome Focus:** Databases, relational schema design, secure parameterized queries, and data access integration.

This section explains how each artifact supports the CS program outcomes.
- **Software Design & Engineering:**  
  Demonstrated through modular design, layered architecture, and clean interfaces in the Course Planner refactor.
- **Algorithms & Data Structures:**  
  Demonstrated by comparing and analyzing multiple data structures for course storage and retrieval, with attention to runtime performance and trade-offs.
- **Databases:**  
  Demonstrated via integration of MySQL with parameterized queries, schema design for the `courses` table, and dynamic loading/saving of course data.

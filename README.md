<p align="center">Hello! I'm Emily, and I’m currently completing my B.S. in Computer Science at SNHU, graduating in December 2025. I discovered a strong interest in data analysis and business intelligence through my coursework, and I’m excited to pursue a career where I can transform data into insights that support better decision-making.</p>

Welcome to my CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio. This portfolio showcases my enhanced artifacts, reflections, and mastery of the program outcomes, including:

- Software Design and Engineering
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Databases

It also connects these artifacts to my long-term goals as an aspiring **Data Analyst** and **Business Intelligence Analyst**.

Below are the three main enhanced artifacts aligned with the capstone categories. Each artifact includes a summary, the associated outcome, and links to code and reflections.  
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="images/artifact1.png"></div>

**Artifact:** Refactored Course Planner application  
**Original Course:** CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms  
**Summary:** The original single-file Course Planner was redesigned into a modular, multi-layered application with separate classes for the model (`Course`), data access (`CourseRepository`), service logic (`CourseService`), and user interface (`MenuUI`). This refactor improves readability, maintainability, and scalability.  
**Outcome Focus:** Software design, modular architecture, and clean separation of concerns.

<div align="center"><img src="images/artifact2.png"></div>

**Artifact:** Data structures performance comparison (vector, hash table, binary search tree)
**Original Course:** CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms
**Summary:** This artifact analyzes how different data structures perform for loading, searching, and traversing course data. The enhancement work includes fleshed-out pseudocode, runtime measurements, and reflection on when each data structure is most appropriate.
**Outcome Focus:** Algorithmic thinking, time complexity, and choosing appropriate data structures.

<div align="center"><img src="images/artifact3.png"></div>

**Artifact:** Course Planner with MySQL database support (CS-300 enhanced in CS-499) 
**Original Course:** CS-300: Data Structures & Algorithms
**Summary:** For Milestone Four, the Course Planner was extended to load and save course data using a MySQL relational database. A `courses` table stores `course_id`, `title`, and `prereqs`. The application uses MySQL Connector/C++ with parameterized SQL queries, and the user may choose to load data either from a CSV file or directly from the database.
**Outcome Focus:** Databases, relational schema design, secure parameterized queries, and data access integration.

<div align="center"><img src="images/outcomes-header.png"></div>
This section explains how each artifact supports the CS program outcomes:

**Software Design & Engineering:** Demonstrated through modular design, layered architecture, and clean interfaces in the Course Planner refactor.
**Algorithms & Data Structures:** Demonstrated by comparing and analyzing multiple data structures for course storage and retrieval, with attention to runtime performance and trade-offs.
**Databases:** Demonstrated via integration of MySQL with parameterized queries, schema design for the `courses` table, and dynamic loading/saving of course data.

*Refactored Course Planner Application*

<br>
<img src="../images/original-artifact-header.png">  

The original artifact was a Course Planner console application created for **CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms**. The program loaded course data from a CSV file and allowed users to view a sorted list of courses and display course prerequisites. The original implementation was contained in a single source file with tightly coupled logic.

For the capstone, the Course Planner was redesigned using object-oriented and modular software design principles. The application was refactored into multiple classes with clear responsibilities:

- `Course`: Represents the course data model  
- `CourseRepository`: Manages loading and storing course data  
- `CourseService`: Contains business logic and formatting operations  
- `MenuUI`: Handles user interaction and input validation  

Additional enhancements include improved input validation, structured exception handling, and expanded inline documentation to improve maintainability and readability.

This artifact demonstrates the following skills and technologies:

- Object-oriented design and separation of concerns  
- Modular C++ application architecture  
- Use of header and source files  
- Input validation and exception handling  
- Code documentation and maintainability practices

This artifact primarily supports the **Software Design & Engineering** program outcome. By refactoring the application into a modular, layered architecture, this enhancement demonstrates the ability to design, implement, and evaluate a computing solution using appropriate software engineering practices and modern development techniques.

*Data Structures Performance Comparison*

<br>
<img src="../../images/original-artifact-head.png">  

The original artifact was created for **CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms** and focused on storing and retrieving course data using different data structures. The program included pseudocode-level logic for vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees, but lacked detailed performance analysis and structured comparison of algorithmic trade-offs.

For the capstone, this artifact was enhanced by expanding the original pseudocode into a detailed comparison of three data structures: vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. Each structure was evaluated based on loading, searching, and traversal operations. The enhancement emphasizes understanding *when* and *why* each data structure should be selected depending on dataset size, access patterns, and performance requirements.

Additional enhancements include clearer documentation, refined pseudocode logic, and structured reflection on runtime behavior and algorithmic efficiency.

This artifact demonstrates the following skills and technologies:

- Algorithmic thinking and problem decomposition  
- Comparison of data structures and time complexity  
- Evaluation of performance trade-offs  
- Use of pseudocode to plan efficient implementations  
- Analytical reasoning and technical documentation

This artifact directly supports the **Algorithms & Data Structures** program outcome. By analyzing and comparing multiple data structures, this enhancement demonstrates the ability to design, evaluate, and select appropriate computing solutions based on efficiency, scalability, and problem constraints.

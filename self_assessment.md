# Professional Self-Assessment  
*CS-499 Computer Science Capstone*  
*Emily Black*

Throughout my academic journey in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have grown significantly both technically and professionally. When I began the program, I expected to pursue software engineering or full-stack development. However, as I progressed, especially after excelling in Applied Statistics I and II, I discovered my strengths and passions lie in data-focused roles. I deeply enjoy analyzing information, uncovering insights, and helping others make informed decisions. This led me to pursue a long-term career goal of becoming a **Business Intelligence Analyst**, a role that blends analytical reasoning with organizational impact.

The capstone enhancements showcased in this ePortfolio demonstrate my mastery of the five Computer Science Program Outcomes and reflect the culmination of everything I have learned throughout my degree. Revisiting previous coursework, redesigning artifacts, and applying feedback allowed me to grow into a more intentional and capable computing professional.

## ## Outcome 1: Collaborating in a Team or Professional Environment
I strengthened my collaboration and communication skills throughout the program and during the capstone. In **Milestone One**, I performed a detailed code review that required analyzing another developer’s work, identifying improvement opportunities, and articulating recommendations clearly. This experience reflects the ability to contribute to team-based problem-solving and support organizational goals, which is central to Outcome 1.

## ## Outcome 2: Professional Communication
Professional communication was demonstrated through written enhancement narratives, UML diagrams, and my recorded screencast review. Explaining software architecture decisions, algorithmic trade-offs, and database integration strategies reinforced my ability to communicate technical information to both technical and non-technical audiences. This ePortfolio is also intentionally structured to demonstrate clarity, organization, and professionalism.

## ## Outcome 3: Problem-Solving Using Algorithms and Data Structures
I demonstrated my understanding of algorithmic design and evaluation by enhancing my **CS-300 Data Structures Comparison** artifact. This included expanding the pseudocode, analyzing runtime performance, and comparing the trade-offs among vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. This aligns with Outcome 3 by showcasing my ability to design and assess computing solutions using appropriate algorithmic techniques.

## ## Outcome 4: Developing Software Using Modern Tools and Techniques
A major artifact in this ePortfolio is the redesigned **Course Planner** application. I transformed it from a single-file program into a modular, multi-layered, object-oriented application. Later, I expanded it further by integrating a relational **MySQL database** using MySQL Connector/C++ and secure parameterized SQL queries. These enhancements demonstrate my ability to use modern tools, frameworks, and development techniques, fully addressing Outcome 4.

---

## ## Outcome 5: Incorporating Security Principles into Software
I demonstrated secure coding practices by adding input validation, strengthening exception handling, and documenting best practices for secure credential storage. Although the capstone environment uses hard-coded credentials for demonstration, I clearly note that production systems require environment variables or secure credential stores. This satisfies Outcome 5 by showing an understanding of potential vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them.

## ## Final Reflection
Across all milestones, I earned **100%**, reflecting mastery of both the technical and professional expectations of the CS program. The process of refining previous coursework, enhancing it with modern practices, and preparing it for public presentation helped me develop a professional identity grounded in clarity, intentionality, and analytical rigor.

This ePortfolio synthesizes my growth in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. It also reflects my readiness to enter the workforce as a data-driven professional capable of supporting business intelligence, analytics, and organizational decision-making. Completing the capstone has solidified my confidence and prepared me to move forward into a fulfilling career in **Data Analysis** or **Business Intelligence**.
